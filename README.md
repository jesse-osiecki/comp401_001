===========

Assignment 1. Simply a test of github for future stuff.
##Notice if you are a student in this or future 401 classes,
it is cheating to take this code. I did not authorize you to take this, and just because it is on the inernet
does not mean that you have the right to copy it. You are bound by the University Honor Code, please abide by it.
Frankly, I can't afford to make all of these repos private; the less important ones don't get that luxury
